Three types of proxies:
1. Virtual Proxy: A virtual proxy is a placeholder for an object that is expensive to create. It creates the real object only when it is needed. This is useful for optimizing performance and resource usage.
2. Protection Proxy: A protection proxy controls access to the real object. It can restrict access based on user permissions or other criteria. This is useful for security and access control.
3. Remote Proxy: A remote proxy represents an object that is located in a different address space. It allows communication between the client and the remote object. This is useful for distributed systems and network communication.
